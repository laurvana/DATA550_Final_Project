# How to build the Docker Image

by running the following command, `make project_image_inla`, the docker image "project_image_inla" will be built using the `Dockerfile` saved in this repository.

# Generating the Final Report with Docker 

Please find the link to the project_image_inla on DockerHub here: https://hub.docker.com/r/laurvana/project_image_inla

With this image, you can generate the `Final_Project_Report.pdf` using the following make command:

 `make report/Final_Project_Report.pdf`

This command builds the final report automatically by running the image called "project_image_inla". The final report should appear in the `report` folder located on your local computer. Recall that if you are using git bash on Windows, you will need an extra /, i.e., "/$(pwd)" when mounting a directory within the `report/Final_Project_Report.pdf` make command.
